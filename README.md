# Cracking the Coding Interview - Snippets

Based on exercises from [Cracking the Coding Interview](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cracking_the_Coding_Interview) book, I created this repository for study purpose.

## About the algorithms

I used a restriction for my codes **Use only "Java Standard Library"**, in order to avoid to "cheat" the exercises, so in many cases I choosed to not use a Java 8+ features or some lib, to solve "magically" the problem.

Besides, those snippets should run in online platforms, like: CodinGame, CodeWards, HackerRank, Codility, SoloLearn, etc...

However I established this "rule" after wrote some codes, so one of them were not respect the restriction.

That's OK to have "cheated" solutions, but only if have more than one solution for the problem, and at least one of them should respect the "standard lib" rule.

All the snippets was made and tested by me, and possibly some of them are not the best solution, so I'll be glad if you give to me a feedback =]

## The project organization

* Each java file represent a chapter from the book;
* The name of file follow the pattern: [chapter_numer]_[NameOfChapter]_Snippets.java
  * e.g. **01_ArraysAndString_Snippets.java**
* To turn easier the identification of the libs that I've used, I kept the imports
